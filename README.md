# Heart Failure prediction(Interactive dashboard created using Tableau)
## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is analysis of patient health data in order to predict the possibilities of heart failure and identify key factors influencing patient outcomes. Through data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, this project aims to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare and enhance detection of heart failure and risks.

## Dataset used:
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data" target="_blank">Dataset</a>

## KPIs(Key performance Indicators)
-What is the overall mortality rate (percentage of patients who experienced a death event)?
-How does mortality differ between males and females?
-What is the relationship between age and mortality rate?
-How does ejection fraction (heart pumping efficiency) relate to survival outcomes?
-What is the correlation between serum creatinine levels and death events?
-How does serum sodium level affect the likelihood of heart failure death?
-Is there a higher death rate among patients with anaemia compared to those without?
-Does diabetes increase the risk of death in heart failure patients?
What is the mortality difference between patients with and without high blood pressure?
-Is smoking associated with a higher probability of death (heart failure event)?
-How does creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level correlate with survival status?
-What is the average survival time for patients who died vs. those who survived?
